            <p>I am currently unemployed. I graduated a highschool called Friendship Christian in 2021 and I went to
                Winston-Salem State University for a year. Growing up, I was alwayds into computers. I believe I got
                that from my older brother.
                He was always learning something about computers but something that immediatly caught my attention is
                coding. Something about being able
                crate my own thing just always amazed me.</p>
            <p>While I was in college, I couldn't really find much intertest in it and I never really liked
                the idea that it would take 4+ years to do what I really wanted to do. So my brother introduced me to
                thinkful.
                I Thought it was pretty cool so I looked into it and immediatly applied for it. I also took a udemy
                course called
                "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022." I learned a lot of things that I think prepared
                me well for this program and I am very excited to see where this program takes me.
            </p>
            <p>Along with coding I enjoy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing basketball</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
